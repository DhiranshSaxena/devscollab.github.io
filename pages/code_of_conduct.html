                <h4>Our Pledge</h4>
                <p>
                    In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming
		    environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to
		    making participation in our project and our community a
		    harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
		    body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
		    gender identity and expression, level of experience,
		    education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
                    appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
		    orientation.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Our Standards</h4>
                <p>
                    Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive
 		    environment include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
                    <li> Being respectful of differing viewpoints and
		         experiences</li>
                    <li> Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
                    <li> Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
                    <li> Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
                </ul><br>
                <p>
                    Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome
 			 sexual attention or advances</li>
                    <li> Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal
			 or political attacks</li>
                    <li> Public or private harassment</li>

                </ul><br>
                <h4>Our Responsibilities</h4>
                <p>
                    Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the
		    standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take
		    appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any
		    instances of unacceptable behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to
		    remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits,
 		    issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this
 		    Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
 		    contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
                    threatening, offensive, or harmful.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Scope</h4>
                <p>
                    This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and
 		    in public spaces when an individual is representing the
		    project or its community. Examples of representing a project
 		    or community include using an official project e-mail
                    address, posting via an official social media account, or
 		    acting as an appointed representative at an online or
		    offline event. Representation of a project may be further
		    defined and clarified by project maintainers.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Enforcement</h4>
                <p>
                    Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable
 		    behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at
 		    devscollab@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and
		    investigated and will result in a response that is deemed
		    necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project
 		    team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to
 		    the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific
		    enforcement policies may be posted separately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of
 		    Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent
		    repercussions as determined by other members of the
		    project's leadership.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Attribution</h4>
